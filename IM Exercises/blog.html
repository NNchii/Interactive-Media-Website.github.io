                    <p><i><strong>Setting Up Git:</strong></i></p>
                    <p>
                        I have already set up my Github from last year’s Digital Art Design Practice group work, although I had run into a few errors prior regarding file sharing through the repository, I was able to resolve those problems relatively quickly.

                    <p><i><strong>Reading Reflection:</strong></i></p>
                    <p>
                        With this week’s reading “Library of Babel” it really reflects the current state of the internet perfectly. The overwhelming and over abundance of information on the internet is very much like the information present within the library and the difficulty in acquiring information within the library too reflects the state of the internet, when we search something up, immediately we are presented what seems to be a countless number of result pages that immediately overwhelms the viewer, but on a closer look, all the presented websites contains relatively the same information on said topic to the point where the person searching. Personally I think this overwhelming exposure of information actually causes an underwhelming of information to take place, where information is so in abundance and so easy to access, people tend to take them at the face value, where it is so easy to access the information to fact check a topic, most people now would not even bother due to the convoluted nature of the internet.

                    <p><i><strong>My goal for this course:</strong></i></p>
                    <p>
                        My goal with this course is to learn both Java script and HTMP to build upon my existing coding knowledge as well as to learn both the proper theory and practice to what makes a website successful.

                    <p><i><strong>Experience with HTML:</strong></i></p>
                    <p>
                        My experience with HTML prior to this course was pretty much little to none, although I have played around with the web inspector before by finding different text that was displayed on the site and changing it to something else completely so I guess I can recognise some sort of structure when it comes to the coding of a website. Personally I did struggle when I first picked up C# Last year so dealing with a brand new language now will definitely take some time to learn and get used to, but I am excited to learn more and design a fully functional website after my few attempts at prototyping which was mainly just playing around with the formatting and display texts.

                    <p><i><strong>Reflection on the reading:</strong></i></p>
                    <p>
                        This week however was somewhat stressful with the potential danger posed by the ongoing protest. I ended up missing both Wednesday and Thursday lessons in person which ended up causing me to lag behind for a few days. The reading “Why You Should Choose HTML5” by Bruce Lawson shows just how important the usage of the correct semantic mark-up whilst coding a website is in order to build a website that ensures proper readability and accessibility for the user when browsing the site which in turn improve its functionality as a whole.

                    <p><i><strong>Additional Resources:</strong></i></p>
                    <p>
                        Other than the class materials, I did look up a few tutorials on YouTube which helped me to improve at understanding and coding with HTML, however it will still take a bit of getting use to since the code is still pretty new to me. In addition this week we looked at the history of the internet which was definitely fascinating, seeing the evolution of the internet and the technological and social elements that made what it is today as well as the impact it has upon the modern world. It was also important to learn where it's short comings are as it exist within the new social climate and how can we improve upon it in order to create sites that can more positively impact today's world.
