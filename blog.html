                    <p>
                        I have already set up my Github from last year’s Digital Art Design Practice group work, although I had run into a few errors prior regarding file sharing through the repository, I was able to resolve those problems relatively quickly.

                    <p>
                        With this week’s reading “Library of Babel” it really reflects the current state of the internet perfectly. The overwhelming and over abundance of information on the internet is very much like the information present within the library and the difficulty in acquiring information within the library too reflects the state of the internet, when we search something up, immediately we are presented what seems to be a countless number of result pages that immediately overwhelms the viewer, but on a closer look, all the presented websites contains relatively the same information on said topic to the point where the person searching. Personally I think this overwhelming exposure of information actually causes an underwhelming of information to take place, where information is so in abundance and so easy to access, people tend to take them at the face value, where it is so easy to access the information to fact check a topic, most people now would not even bother due to the convoluted nature of the internet.

                    <p>
                        My experience with HTML prior to this course was pretty much little to none, although I have played around with the web inspector before by finding different text that was displayed on the site and changing it to something else completely so I guess I can recognise some sort of structure when it comes to the coding of a website. Personally I did struggle when I first picked up C# Last year so dealing with a brand new language now will definitely take some time to learn and get used to, but I am excited to learn more and design a fully functional website after my few attempts at prototyping which was mainly just playing around with the formatting and display texts.

                        This week however was somewhat stressful with the potential danger posed by the ongoing protest. I ended up missing both Wednesday and Thursday lessons in person which ended up causing me to lag behind for a few days. The reading “Why You Should Choose HTML5” by Bruce Lawson shows just how important the usage of the correct semantic mark-up whilst coding a website is in order to build a website that ensures proper readability and accessibility for the user when browsing the site which in turn improve its functionality as a whole.

                    <p>
                        Other than the class materials, I did look up a few tutorials on YouTube which helped me to improve at understanding and coding with HTML, however it will still take a bit of getting use to since the code is still pretty new to me. In addition this week we looked at the history of the internet which was definitely fascinating, seeing the evolution of the internet and the technological and social elements that made what it is today as well as the impact it has upon the modern world. It was also important to learn where it's short comings are as it exist within the new social climate and how can we improve upon it in order to create sites that can more positively impact today's world.

                    <p>
                        Learning CSS this week was exciting and I have done some experimentations with it to style my website so far. At first I was quite confused and unsure of what I want my website to look like, but after seeing the implementation of CSS alongside HTML I’m leaning towards a modern, simplistic/minimalistic style that looks very clean while the information presented is easy to read and access. My understanding of HTML has increased significantly as well compared to prior weeks so I am excited to see how well I could implement my ideal design into practice.

                    <p>
                        “Convention and Context, Mailoux, 1983” was definitely an interesting and insightful read, it reminds the designers of the importance of considering both established design conventions and the specific context of users when creating digital interfaces. While we as designers should be familiar with the principles and patterns that users have come to expect with websites, they must also be attuned to the specific needs, goals, and audiences of their design projects. By balancing the two, we can create experiences for the user that are intuitive, user-friendly, and tailored to the content presented. Mailoux's emphasis on the interplay between convention and context encourages us to continually reassess and iterate upon our work, ensuring that their designs evolve in response to ever-changing user expectations and technological advancements.

                        The supplementary materials are very useful in helping further my understanding on any concepts I was either unsure about or didn't understand, it also provides a different perspective on concepts I already had a grasp on which allowed me to take multiple different approaches to tackle a certain problem whether it’s the coding issues or design concepts.

                        I have consolidated on my theme of modern minimalistic design for my website this week and grown accustomed to coding both HTML and CSS, starting JavaScript this week I was much more comfortable and confident with it than initially when we first started HTML and CSS mainly due to it being very similar in structure with C# codes. I intend to further refine my design layouts to make it as clean and efficient as possible in delivering the necessary information to the viewers while remaining aesthetically pleasing to browse.

                        I found Uxpin's 2020 article "The Basic Principles of User Interface Design" to be an incredibly helpful and informative resource. Reading it on a web design blog made the content more approachable and engaging, providing me with essential UI design principles like clarity, feedback, flexibility and consistency. This not only served as a reminder of the importance of adhering to best practices, but it also remembered to keep in mind who our target audience is and adjust our design accordingly. This inspired me to innovate and experiment within the boundaries of these foundational concepts.

                        My original wireframe felt a bit cluttered and all over the place, I found in my pursuit for a minimalist design I had done the complete opposite and ended up planning too much elements on the page which is not only gonna hinder my progress with coding issues, but it might end up as a distraction for the viewer instead of efficiently delivering the vital informations.

                        This week I have pretty much finalised the layout of my website and have made considerable progress on both the HTML and CSS, most of my pages are pretty much done or are getting there. There were not many changes I made this week, however I do need to update my wireframe to fit with the new layout as it is quite different from the original designs, but other than that my website will be finalised fairly soon
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Goal Alignment: My goal with the website is to create a modern, minimalist and elegant style that is easy to navigate for the viewers and is easy to read. The users I designed this website for are one for the markers, two for like minded individuals that I may potentially form partnerships for future opportunities as well as for my future employment as a web designer. My content is based on this course’s work as well as to show my decision making and growth as a web designer for my future portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Information structure: The information structure of my website is clear and simple with minimal amount of distractions for the viewer, all the information is structured to be easily read and understood and clearly marked so if one wishes to seek out a specific section of my work, it should be relatively easy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        User Flow: The user flow of my website is designed to be nonlinear, the user is first presented with the home page that displays a small, but relative information about me and then they are free to explorer the different pages as they see if, the information of each page are displayed linearly, however everything is clearly labelled so that if they wish to seek out a specific piece of information, they could easily find it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interface Elements: Due to my website being relatively simple, the only interface elements are the buttons to swap from page to page, I find too many interface elements a page to be cluttered and often causes confusion for the viewer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Design: My design document is getting filled as I continue with my website. Once the document is finalised I will add it to my design page, however so far I am very much liking the design I have managed to create. The wireframe design also needs to be updated with the changes I’ve made.

                    <p id="blog-sub-title"><strong>Reflection on the reading:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The main thing I got from this week’s reading is that we as designers cannot create a design that would cater to all and we can’t expect our audience to obtain the same experiences with our designs as we did. The authors argue that UX should not solely focus on usability and functionality but also on intangible, experiential aspects that can create positive, memorable, and meaningful interactions between users and technology, thus we as designers have to take a more comprehensive approach to UX designing that encompasses all aspects of user experience, ultimately leading to the creation of more engaging, enjoyable, and meaningful websites.

                        What went wrong:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were a few areas where I had alignment issues and I had to play around with the CSS code to try to get it in place which I’m not sure if I did it right or not. My original homepage had to be altered cause I realised the texts would overlap one another when viewed on my laptop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What went right:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I generally feel like the overall look of my website, the layout, colour palette and the clean, modern aesthetic looked extremely well and the text layout is rather unique which doesn’t look boring. I especially like my profile page that displays my information around my picture and the design page with the wireframe and design document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where did you struggle:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main thing I struggled with was the CSS formatting, there were parts where it was a challenge to get the correct formatting with the large title text keeping to the right while the main content text is kept to the left side, a lot of the time the format would get messed up when I added more content or text would start overlapping with one another as it got longer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What would you do differently:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’d definitely work more on the semantic markups as at the moment I had a lot of divs. I’d try to make a navigation link for the longer pages like the design page and the blog page so it is easier to navigate for the user without having to scroll up and down through the long sections of texts, I also want to try to have the header to stay with the page so the user won’t have to go all the way back up to change page.

                        The reading underscores the significance of geographic considerations in web development between the global south and the north. As a South African web developer, it emphasises to me the need to ensure accessibility and usability across diverse locations and considering factors like internet connectivity and cultural nuances.

                        Ballatore's 2017 paper on "Digital Hegemonies" provides a critical perspective on the influence of search engine algorithms on the visibility of local content. It shows the importance of understanding and optimising these algorithms to ensure the local content is adequately represented in search results instead of digital hegemonies of certain prioritised regions over others and It also emphasises the need to be aware of the potential biases in these algorithms and to strive for a more inclusive and representative digital landscape. These two papers highlight the uneven distribution of digital resources and power as it prioritises information from certain privileged areas of the globe over others and the importance of advocating for more representation of the diverse internet environment across the globe.

                    <p>
                        I’ve been trying to implement JavaScript to my website, however I have run into a fair bit of issue. The language is far more complexed and unforgiving than both HTML and CSS, however knowing C# From Game Design I can see a few resemblances which are making it easier to understand the structure of JS. I plan on making a few optimisation and quality of life functions for my site that allows for more streamlined and clean navigation. I’ll continue to experiment with it and see where I can end up although with other course works the progress has been somewhat slow.

                    <p>
                        In Digital inequalities in the age of artificial intelligence and big data, the author Lutz provides a detailed review on the digital inequalities in the modern internet landscape. The article presents three different levels of digital divide being the access to digital technology, digital skills and technology use and the results and outcome from the use of technology.

                    <p>
                        The first level of digital divide refers to the unequal access of the internet, where Lutz argues that while the general access of the internet is widespread in the rich countries of the world, the access to the specific parts of the internet such as social media, mobile data, and smart devices and AI powered technology is still just limited to a small portion of the overall digital users which creates a divide between the average people and the more privileged elites of society.

                    <p>
                        The second level of digital divide is the inequalities of digital skill and technology use. Lutz presents the digital divide and inequalities between the skill gap within the digital space that is often dominated by AI and large data based technologies within the digital economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third level of digital divide is a relatively new concept where it refers to the differences gained from internet usage. Lutz argues that in today’s internet landscape, data traces are an important outcome from internet usage which may grant advantages or disadvantages that are unevenly distributed within society.

                    <p>
                        I’m honestly already amazed with CSS after finding out some of the stuff you can do with CSS alone to make the website design to be more responsive and sleek, but after working JS with CSS I feel like the possibilities to expand onto my web design are endless. So far I have improved the user navigation through my webpage by adding both the nav links as well as making the header slide up and down in accordance with the user’s scroll control to make users able to access the header at any point in the page.
                    </p>

                    <p id="blog-sub-title"><strong>Responsive Design:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The benefits of responsive design is that it makes the user experience with the website much more enjoyable, having feedback for everything they do makes the website feel lively and encourages the user to continue with the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The challenges of responsive design is mainly deciding what sort of responsive design should be implemented where and the code to make them. So far what I have implemented for responsive design have been the change of size for the text when hovered over as well as the smooth scroll function. I have also made the header respond to the user’s scroll so when they scroll down, the header slides up and out of the way so it does not abstract any content while when the user scrolls up it reappears so the user can access the page navigation at any time they wish.
