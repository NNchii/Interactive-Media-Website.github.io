                    <p>
                        I have already set up my Github from last year’s Digital Art Design Practice group work, although I had run into a few errors prior regarding file sharing through the repository, I was able to resolve those problems relatively quickly.

                    <p>
                        With this week’s reading “Library of Babel” it really reflects the current state of the internet perfectly. The overwhelming and over abundance of information on the internet is very much like the information present within the library and the difficulty in acquiring information within the library too reflects the state of the internet, when we search something up, immediately we are presented what seems to be a countless number of result pages that immediately overwhelms the viewer, but on a closer look, all the presented websites contains relatively the same information on said topic to the point where the person searching. Personally I think this overwhelming exposure of information actually causes an underwhelming of information to take place, where information is so in abundance and so easy to access, people tend to take them at the face value, where it is so easy to access the information to fact check a topic, most people now would not even bother due to the convoluted nature of the internet.

                        My goal with this course is to learn both Java script and HTMP to build upon my existing coding knowledge as well as to learn both the proper theory and practice to what makes a website successful.

                    <p>
                        My experience with HTML prior to this course was pretty much little to none, although I have played around with the web inspector before by finding different text that was displayed on the site and changing it to something else completely so I guess I can recognise some sort of structure when it comes to the coding of a website. Personally I did struggle when I first picked up C# Last year so dealing with a brand new language now will definitely take some time to learn and get used to, but I am excited to learn more and design a fully functional website after my few attempts at prototyping which was mainly just playing around with the formatting and display texts.

                        This week however was somewhat stressful with the potential danger posed by the ongoing protest. I ended up missing both Wednesday and Thursday lessons in person which ended up causing me to lag behind for a few days. The reading “Why You Should Choose HTML5” by Bruce Lawson shows just how important the usage of the correct semantic mark-up whilst coding a website is in order to build a website that ensures proper readability and accessibility for the user when browsing the site which in turn improve its functionality as a whole.

                    <p id="blog-sub-title"><strong>Additional Resources:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Other than the class materials, I did look up a few tutorials on YouTube which helped me to improve at understanding and coding with HTML, however it will still take a bit of getting use to since the code is still pretty new to me. In addition this week we looked at the history of the internet which was definitely fascinating, seeing the evolution of the internet and the technological and social elements that made what it is today as well as the impact it has upon the modern world. It was also important to learn where it's short comings are as it exist within the new social climate and how can we improve upon it in order to create sites that can more positively impact today's world.

                    <p>
                        Learning CSS this week was exciting and I have done some experimentations with it to style my website so far. At first I was quite confused and unsure of what I want my website to look like, but after seeing the implementation of CSS alongside HTML I’m leaning towards a modern, simplistic/minimalistic style that looks very clean while the information presented is easy to read and access. My understanding of HTML has increased significantly as well compared to prior weeks so I am excited to see how well I could implement my ideal design into practice.

                        “Convention and Context, Mailoux, 1983” was definitely an interesting and insightful read, it reminds the designers of the importance of considering both established design conventions and the specific context of users when creating digital interfaces. While we as designers should be familiar with the principles and patterns that users have come to expect with websites, they must also be attuned to the specific needs, goals, and audiences of their design projects. By balancing the two, we can create experiences for the user that are intuitive, user-friendly, and tailored to the content presented. Mailoux's emphasis on the interplay between convention and context encourages us to continually reassess and iterate upon our work, ensuring that their designs evolve in response to ever-changing user expectations and technological advancements.

                    <p>
                        The supplementary materials are very useful in helping further my understanding on any concepts I was either unsure about or didn't understand, it also provides a different perspective on concepts I already had a grasp on which allowed me to take multiple different approaches to tackle a certain problem whether it’s the coding issues or design concepts.

                        I have consolidated on my theme of modern minimalistic design for my website this week and grown accustomed to coding both HTML and CSS, starting JavaScript this week I was much more comfortable and confident with it than initially when we first started HTML and CSS mainly due to it being very similar in structure with C# codes. I intend to further refine my design layouts to make it as clean and efficient as possible in delivering the necessary information to the viewers while remaining aesthetically pleasing to browse.

                        I found Uxpin's 2020 article "The Basic Principles of User Interface Design" to be an incredibly helpful and informative resource. Reading it on a web design blog made the content more approachable and engaging, providing me with essential UI design principles like clarity, feedback, flexibility and consistency. This not only served as a reminder of the importance of adhering to best practices, but it also remembered to keep in mind who our target audience is and adjust our design accordingly. This inspired me to innovate and experiment within the boundaries of these foundational concepts.

                    <p>
                        My original wireframe felt a bit cluttered and all over the place, I found in my pursuit for a minimalist design I had done the complete opposite and ended up planning too much elements on the page which is not only gonna hinder my progress with coding issues, but it might end up as a distraction for the viewer instead of efficiently delivering the vital informations.

                        This week I have pretty much finalised the layout of my website and have made considerable progress on both the HTML and CSS, most of my pages are pretty much done or are getting there. There were not many changes I made this week, however I do need to update my wireframe to fit with the new layout as it is quite different from the original designs, but other than that my website will be finalised fairly soon

                    <p>
                        Goal Alignment: My goal with the website is to create a modern, minimalist and elegant style that is easy to navigate for the viewers and is easy to read. The users I designed this website for are one for the markers, two for like minded individuals that I may potentially form partnerships for future opportunities as well as for my future employment as a web designer. My content is based on this course’s work as well as to show my decision making and growth as a web designer for my future portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Information structure: The information structure of my website is clear and simple with minimal amount of distractions for the viewer, all the information is structured to be easily read and understood and clearly marked so if one wishes to seek out a specific section of my work, it should be relatively easy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        User Flow: The user flow of my website is designed to be nonlinear, the user is first presented with the home page that displays a small, but relative information about me and then they are free to explorer the different pages as they see if, the information of each page are displayed linearly, however everything is clearly labelled so that if they wish to seek out a specific piece of information, they could easily find it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interface Elements: Due to my website being relatively simple, the only interface elements are the buttons to swap from page to page, I find too many interface elements a page to be cluttered and often causes confusion for the viewer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Design: My design document is getting filled as I continue with my website. Once the document is finalised I will add it to my design page, however so far I am very much liking the design I have managed to create. The wireframe design also needs to be updated with the changes I’ve made.

                    <p id="blog-sub-title"><strong>Reflection on the reading:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The main thing I got from this week’s reading is that we as designers cannot create a design that would cater to all and we can’t expect our audience to obtain the same experiences with our designs as we did. The authors argue that UX should not solely focus on usability and functionality but also on intangible, experiential aspects that can create positive, memorable, and meaningful interactions between users and technology, thus we as designers have to take a more comprehensive approach to UX designing that encompasses all aspects of user experience, ultimately leading to the creation of more engaging, enjoyable, and meaningful websites.
