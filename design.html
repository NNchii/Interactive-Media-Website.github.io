                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        I aim to design a contemporary, minimalist, and responsive website that embodies a sleek and sophisticated aesthetic while effectively presenting information to visitors and is easy to navigate. As they navigate through my portfolio, users will be able to explore my web design expertise and gain insight into my diverse range of projects and experiences.

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        My aspiration for this website is to captivate individuals who share a mutual appreciation for similar design styles and aesthetics. By appealing to this audience, I hope to foster potential collaborations, establish meaningful connections, and ultimately attract prospective clients or partners who value the same creative vision and principles.

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        My content I hope to showcase on this website is the design processes of my work, the detailed explanations for the decisions Iâ€™ve made and design elements I have implemented as well as a step-by-step documentation of my personal growth as a web developer from my time during this course. Also, my personal portfolio as a game designer as well for my viewer to see my past projects as well as my coding skills in both web design and game design fields.

                    <p>
                        The webpage is divided into three primary sections: blogs, design, essays, profile, and portfolio with each having its own dedicated page. Within these sections, content is organised by categories or weeks, featuring distinct headings and titles for seamless navigation and content discovery. Underneath the page title contains the navigation links as well as a button that takes the user back to the beginning of the page, when pressed it takes the user down to the specific section, they wished to see seamlessly which provides an easy way to navigate without excessive scrolling. The website's design embraces minimalism, a footer is added with microformat for the users to have access to my information such as contact details and name. The website utilises a consistent colour scheme and typography, resulting in a cohesive and visually engaging user experience. Overall, the website's information architecture effectively showcases the work and delivers a clear and user-friendly experience for visitors.

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        The visual aesthetic of the website is modern and minimalist. The use of a neutral colour palette and clean typography creates a sleek and professional look. The layout is structured and organised, making it easy for the user to navigate and find the information they need. The addition of subtle shadow effects and faint underlines add depth and dimension to the design without being distracting. The interactable texts enlarge when hovering signifying an interactable element, when scrolled down a button will appear to take the user back to the top, the single arrow follows the minimalist style of the website and the navigation bar that extend and retracts from the userâ€™s input all to create a responsive feedback to the userâ€™s actions Overall, the website's visual aesthetic is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, reflecting a sophisticated and contemporary design style. Animation has been added for the websiteâ€™s content to make it feel livelier as the viewer changes page, the content no longer just displays statically from the start, instead the texts transition from either left or bottom to their intended position which further reinforce the responsive design.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p id="sub-section-title"><strong>Possible visual design elements:</strong></p>

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Fonts</b> - The website mainly uses the sans-serif font family, which is commonly used for modern and minimalistic designs. The headings use a bold and large font size to draw attention, while the body text uses a smaller font size for readability. Overall, the font choices are appropriate for the minimalist aesthetic of the website.
                    </p>

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Readability and legibility</b> - The text on the website is easy to read due to the appropriate font size and contrast with the background. The use of white background and black text helps ensure legibility, the light grey underlines after each blog post subtlety shows the viewer the end of the blog post, but not so visible as to disturb the overall clean aesthetic of the page. Important texts are in bold compared to the section contents and the interactable texts are enlarged when hovered over to provide a clear visual indication that the text is interactable.
                    </p>

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Colour</b> - The website uses a limited colour palette with mostly neutral tones such as white, black, and shades of grey. This supports the minimalist and modern aesthetic of the website. The use of faint grey for underlines to subtly show the end of a blog and shadows to highlight the titles through contrast also contributes to the overall design. The slight gradient shift as the user scrolls further down provides a subtle feel of texture even with the simple colour palette so that the site does not feel boring and empty.

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Minimalistic style</b> - Minimalistic style: My website employs a minimalist design style with a clean and uncluttered layout, which creates a simple and elegant look. The use of white space and minimal text also contributes to this minimalist aesthetic.
                    </p>

                        <b>Readability and legibility</b> - The fonts used are highly legible and easy to read. The text is presented in a clear and concise manner to ensure optimal readability. Interactable texts enlarge when hovered over to provide a clear indication to the viewer while important texts are also in bold in comparison to content text which further increases the readability and legibility of the website content.
                    </p>

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Colour Palette</b> - The website uses a limited colour palette, primarily consisting of shades of grey and white. This helps to maintain the minimalist look and feel of the website while also providing a clean and modern look. The slight gradient shift in the background provides a subtle texture for the background so to not feel empty when viewed while not disturbing the overall minimal and clean style.
                    </p>

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Shadow Effects</b> - Shadow effects are used on certain headings and titles to create depth and visual interest and in contrast to the white background further highlights the text and makes it jump out at the viewer. A shadow effect has also been applied to the navigation bar so make it stand out especially with the new header extension and retraction.
                    </p>

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Typography</b> - The website uses a consistent and simple typography, with headings in larger font sizes and body text in smaller font sizes. This consistency helps to create a cohesive look and make it easy for users to navigate the website.

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Alignment</b> - The use of consistent alignment throughout the website contributes to its minimalist aesthetic. Elements are aligned to a grid and are centred within their respective containers. This helps to create a sense of order and balance on the page. The newly provided nav links follow the existing alignment being displayed either above the content and below the page title so the user wonâ€™t miss it or displayed in a column under the IxD section to follow the existing format while still standing out for the user to notice.
                    </p>

                    <p id="design-content-text">
                        <b>Font</b> - The website uses a sans-serif font family, which is common for modern minimalist designs. The font size and weight are chosen to ensure readability and legibility as well as fit the overall modern minimalistic style.
